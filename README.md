# portfolio
basic showcase of my QA/Automation skills


Welcome to my portfolio... just started today 2/3/2023. I'm no pro yet but I'm certainly no brand new beginner either. I love learning. I'm not afraid to try, or mess things up. If your company is set up right and I'm only commiting branches to your repos there's nothing we can't undo that I have done XD. BUT that won't be the constant, just a step in the journey as we all learn. Bon appetit.

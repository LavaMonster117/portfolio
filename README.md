<h1>Welcome to My Portfolio!</h1>
<em><p>My goal here is to adequately showcase my Manual and Automation QA skills, share what I've learned, and update this portfolio with best practices over time as I refine my skills. This will also act as a teaching environment for people I know who are interested in becoming a QA Engineer. My hopes are to establish a valuable repo to draw from if I were ever to be part of establishing a QA department for a startup, or in the event I become rusty with certain tools and need a refresher, I can just come right back here. Wherever I work, I plan to grow my repo, and hopefully contribute good practices from mine to theirs. Win Win's the goal.</p>
    
<p>Just started today 2/3/2023. I hope to make lots of mistakes so I can learn and become even more POWERFUL!!!</p></em>

<h1>This Repo's Agenda/To do List:</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Instructional How To's for setting up and using gitbash to push code to a repo, and set up Cypress.</li>
    <li>Find a website and demo real world examples of valuable automation tests to have in a company's arsenal, as well as create a well organized Testrail/Test Suite mock-up (aka the filing structure of my manual and automation tests).</li>
    <li>To keep up with my planning/To Do list, take a look at my <a href="https://github.com/LavaMonster117/portfolio/projects?query=is%3Aopen">projects</a>, <a href="https://github.com/LavaMonster117/portfolio/issues"> issues</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/LavaMonster117/portfolio/milestones">milestones</a>; that I've created, am working on, and have closed.

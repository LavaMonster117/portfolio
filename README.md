Basic showcase of my QA/Automation skills, as well as notes in case I, or anyone forgets some concepts and needs a refresher.

The Agenda: 
- Instructional How To's for setting up and using gitbash to push code to a repo, and set up Cypress.
- Find a websited and demo some real example tests a company would want to ensure their website is functioning as intended.

Welcome to my portfolio... just started today 2/3/2023. I'll definitely be updating this over time and the big picture comes together. Hope it accurately demonstrates what I've learned and ability to progress. I hope to make lots of mistakes so I can learn and become even more POWERFUL!!!

Bon appetit.

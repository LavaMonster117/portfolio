<h1>Welcome to My Portfolio!</h1>
<em><p>My goal here is to adequately showcase my Manual and Automation QA skills, share what I've learned, and update this portfolio with best practices over time as I refine my skills. This will also act as a teaching environment for people I know who are interested in becoming a QA Engineer. My hopes are to establish a valuable repo to draw from if I were ever to be part of establishing a QA department for a startup, or in the event I become rusty with certain tools and need a refresher, I can just come right back here. Wherever I work, I plan to grow my repo, and hopefully contribute good practices from mine to theirs. Win Win's the goal.</p>
    
<p>Just started today 2/3/2023. I hope to make lots of mistakes so I can learn and become even more POWERFUL!!!</p></em>

<h1>Welcome to My Portfolio!</h1>
<em>My goal here is to adequately showcase my Manual and Automation QA skills  
share what I've learned, and update this portfolio with best practices over  
time as I refine my skills.</em>

<h2>Why Do This?</h2>
I can see this being valuable not only for getting myself hired into future  
positions, but as this repo grows, I could see this becoming very valuable  
to future startup companies looking to setup their own QA department, as  
well as existing companies to refine their practices in order to become  
even more efficient. 

As I learn from those companies I will continue to update my repos for my  
own learning purposes, while simultaneously sharing those best practices  
at future companies that may be unaware.

<h1>This Repo's Agenda/To do List:</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Instructional How To's for setting up and using gitbash to push code to a repo, and set up Cypress.</li>
    <li>Find a website and demo real world examples of valuable automation tests to have in a company's arsenal, as well as good organization and file structure.</li>
</ul>

Just started today 2/3/2023. I hope to make lots of mistakes so I can learn and become even more POWERFUL!!!

<h3>Note:</h3>

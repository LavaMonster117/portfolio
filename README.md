<h1>Welcome to My Portfolio!</h1>
<em>My goal here is to adequately showcase my Manual and Automation QA skills share what I've learned, and update this portfolio with best practices over time as I refine my skills.</em>

<h1>This Repo's Agenda/To do List:</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Instructional How To's for setting up and using gitbash to push code to a repo, and set up Cypress.</li>
    <li>Find a website and demo real world examples of valuable automation tests to have in a company's arsenal, as well as good organization and file structure.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Why Do This?</h2>
Just started today 2/3/2023. I hope to make lots of mistakes so I can learn and become even more POWERFUL!!!  

As I learn from those companies I will continue to update my repos for my own learning purposes, as well as educating people interested in becoming a QA Engineer. This could also become valueable if I ever become part of a startup that has no QA department and needs that set up, so this will work as a solid template to go off of in time. This also helps me to keep up on my QA knowledge and skill set, especially if I need a refresher on tools I may not use for a while.  

<h3>CONTRIBUTORS NOTE:</h3>
